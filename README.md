# Overview

TyTools is a collection of **independent tools** and you only need one executable to use
any of them. The Qt-based GUI tools are statically compiled to make that possible.

Tool        | Type                      | Description
----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------
TyCommander | Qt GUI (static)           | Upload, monitor and communicate with multiple boards
TyUploader  | Qt GUI (static)           | Simple firmware / sketch uploader
tycmd       | Command-line<br>_No Qt !_ | Command-line tool to manage Teensy boards

find [development builds on koromix.dev](https://koromix.dev/files/tytools/).

All the code related to these programs is under **public domain**, you can do whatever you want
with it. See the LICENSE file or [unlicense.org](https://unlicense.org/) for more information.

# Using tycmd

You can manage multiple devices connected simultaneously, tycmd (and the other tools) uniquely
identifies each device by its position in the host USB topology. Meaning if it stays on the same USB
port, it is handled as the same device. That's necessary because across reboots and resets, Teensies
look completely different to the host.

To target a specific device, use `tycmd <command> --board "[<serial>][-<family>][@<location>]"`.
_serial_ is the USB serial number, _family_ is the board family name and _location_ can be the
virtual path computed by tycmd (see `tycmd list`) or an OS device path (e.g. /dev/hidraw1 or COM1).
Any of them can be omitted. See the examples in the table below.

Tag filter         | Effect
------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_714230_           | Select board with serial number 714230
_-Teensy_          | Select board with family name 'Teensy'
_@usb-1-2-2_       | Select board plugged in USB port 'usb-1-2-2'
_@COM1_            | Select board linked to the OS-specific device 'COM1'
_714230@usb-1-2-2_ | Select board plugged in 'usb-1-2-2' and with serial number is 714230

You can learn about the various commands using `tycmd help`. Get specific help for them using
`tycmd help <command>`.

## List devices

`tycmd list` lists plugged Teensy devices. Here is how it looks:

    add 34130@usb-1-2 Teensy 3.1
    add 29460@usb-4-2 Teensy
    add 32250@usb-4-3 Teensy 3.0


Use `--verbose` if you want detailed information about available devices:

    add 32250@usb-4-3 Teensy 3.0
      + capabilities:
        - upload
        - reset
      + interfaces:
        - HalfKay Bootloader: /dev/hidraw2

If you need to read structured information in your scripts, you can set the output to JSON with `--output json`:

    {"action": "add", "tag": "714230@usb-6-3", "serial": 714230, "location": "usb-6-3", "model": "Teensy", "capabilities": ["reboot", "serial"], "interfaces": [["Seremu", "/dev/hidraw4"]]}
    {"action": "add", "tag": "1126140@usb-6-2", "serial": 1126140, "location": "usb-6-2", "model": "Teensy LC", "capabilities": ["upload", "reset"], "interfaces": [["HalfKay Bootloader", "/dev/hidraw3"]]}

You can also watch device changes with `--watch`, both in plain and JSON mode.

Action   | Meaning
-------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_add_    | This board was plugged in or was already there
_change_ | Something changed, maybe the board rebooted
_miss_   | This board is missing, either it was unplugged (remove) or it is changing mode
_remove_ | This board has been missing for some time, consider it removed

## Upload firmware

Use `tycmd upload <filename.hex>` to upload a specific firmware to your device. It is checked for
compatibility with your model before being uploaded.

By default, a reboot is triggered but you can use `--wait` to wait for the bootloader to show up,
meaning tycmd will wait for you to press the button on your board.

## Serial monitor

`tycmd monitor` opens a text connection with your Teensy. It is either done through the serial device
(/dev/ttyACM*) or through the HID serial emulation (SEREMU) in other USB modes. tycmd uses the
correct mode automatically.

You can use the `--reconnect` option to detect I/O errors (such as a reset, or after a brief
unplugging) and reconnect immediately. Other errors will exit the program.

The `--raw` option will disable line-buffering/editing and immediately send everything you type in
the terminal.

See `tycmd help monitor` for other options. Note that Teensy being a USB device, serial settings are
ignored. They are provided in case your application uses them for specific purposes.

## Reset and reboot

`tycmd reset` will restart your device. Since Teensy devices (at least the ARM ones) do not provide
a way to trigger a reset, tycmd will instead start the bootloader first and then issue a reset
without programming anything.

You can also use `tycmd reset -b` to start the bootloader. This is the same as pushing the button on
your Teensy.

# Hacking TyTools

## Build on Windows

You can use MSVC (â‰¥ 2015) or MinGW-w64. I have not tested Clang on Windows yet. The historical
MinGW toolchain is not supported.

You need to install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) to build the project files before you can
use Visual Studio or MinGW.

If **you don't have Qt, only the libraries and command-line tools** will be compiled. There
are two options to enable Qt in TyTools:

- _dynamic Qt build_: Easiest option, you only need to install the pre-built Qt DLLs for
  your compiler with the official Qt installer. The binaries need the Qt DLLs to work.
- _static Qt build_: Harder, but will produce autonomous binaries. Read the README in the
  [lib/qt5 directory](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/tree/master/lib/qt5) for instructions.

To build TyTools with MSVC 2015 32-bit, launch _VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt_,
navigate to the project directory and execute CMake:

```batch
REM You can of course use another build directory if you prefer.
mkdir build
mkdir build/win32
cd build/win32
cmake ../..
```

This will create Visual Studio project and solution files in _build/win32_. You can then open
the _solution TyTools.sln_.

To build 64-bit binaries, you should use _VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt_ instead.

## Build on Mac OS X

Install Xcode, the developer command-line tools and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). The native
Clang compiler can build TyTools.

If **you don't have Qt, only the libraries and command-line tools** will be compiled. There
are two options to enable Qt in TyTools:

- _dynamic Qt build_: Easiest option, you only need to install the pre-built Qt DLLs for
  your compiler with the official Qt installer. The binaries need the Qt DLLs to work.
- _static Qt build_: Harder, but will produce autonomous binaries. Read the README in the
  [lib/qt5 directory](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/tree/master/lib/qt5) for instructions.

After Qt is ready, you can build TyTools by executing the following commands in the
project directory:

```bash
# You can of course use another directory if you prefer.
mkdir -p build/darwin && cd build/darwin
cd build/darwin
cmake ../..
```

If you want to build debug binaries instead, you should specify the build type:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
```

## Build on Linux

TyTools can be built with GCC or Clang.

### Prerequisites

To install the dependencies on Debian or Ubuntu execute:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libudev-dev qtbase5-dev pkg-config
```

On Arch Linux you can do so (as root):

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake udev qt5-base
```

### Compilation

Open the project directory in a terminal and execute:

```bash
# You can of course use another directory if you prefer.
mkdir -p build/linux && cd build/linux
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../..
make
```

If you want to build debug binaries instead, you should specify the build type:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
```

The compiled binaries can be used directly from the build directory. Follow through the
next section if you want to install the application.

### Installation

You can deploy TyTools to your system with the following commands:

```bash
sudo make install
```

By default this will copy the files to `/usr/local`. To change this directory you need
to change the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` value in the Compilation section above.

## Customized builds

A number of customized builds are available in the [variants directory](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/tree/master/variants).

In order to activate a customized build, you need to specify it when running cmake.
For example, in order to build the morningstar variant, run the following commands from the
project directory:

```batch
mkdir build
mkdir build/morningstar
cd build/morningstar
cmake -DCONFIG_VARIANT=morningstar ../..
```
