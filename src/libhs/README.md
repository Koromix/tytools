libhs
=====

libhs is a C library to enumerate HID and serial devices and interact with them. It is:

- **single-file**: one header is all you need to make it work.
- **public domain**: use it, hack it, do whatever you want.
- **multiple platforms**: Windows (≥ Vista), Mac OS X (≥ 10.9) and Linux.
- **multiple compilers**: MSVC (≥ 2015), GCC and Clang.
- **driverless**: uses native OS-provided interfaces and does not require custom drivers.

You can download the library in the [release section](https://github.com/Koromix/libraies).
